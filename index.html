                    SDN, or Software-Defined Networking, is a networking paradigm that separates the network's control plane from the underlying hardware. It centralizes control in a software-based controller, enabling administrators to dynamically configure and manage the network. SDN brings flexibility, scalability, and agility to network infrastructures, allowing for simplified management, optimized resource allocation, and improved security. It empowers organizations to adapt networks to meet modern demands and supports innovative applications and services. SDN is a transformative approach for creating more efficient and responsive networks in the digital age.
